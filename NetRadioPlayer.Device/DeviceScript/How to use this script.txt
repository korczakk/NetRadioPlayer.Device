Copy this file into /etc/systemd/system as root, for example:

sudo cp myscript.service /etc/systemd/system/myscript.service
Once this has been copied, you can attempt to start the service using the following command:

sudo systemctl start myscript.service
Stop it using following command:

sudo systemctl stop myscript.service
When you are happy that this starts and stops your app, you can have it start automatically on reboot by using this command:

sudo systemctl enable myscript.service
